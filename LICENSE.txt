Unless otherwise stated, code in this respository is distributed under the BSD 3-clause license above.

Exceptions are open source libraries used in the project:

The ini folder contains a modified version of the inih library 
(https://github.com/benhoyt/inih). The original is released under 
a New BSD license, which can be seen in the ini folder.

The testing folder contains a header-only library catch.hpp, 
which is distributed under the Boost software license, 
which is included as LICENSE_1_0.txt in the testing folder.

The rng folder contains a modified C++ implementation of 
the xoroshiro128+ random number generation algorithm as 
implemented in C by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna; 
the original version is fully public domain, which no 
license requirements, and can be found here: 
http://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro128plus.c

Some classes in the gillespie and random folders were 
originally developed by the software author, Dylan H. Morris,
for the application Stoched (https://github.com/APC524/stoched).
 Stoched is released under the MIT License copied below, 
and so those files (enumerated here) are as well:

gillespie/Realization.{h,cc}
gillespie/firstreaction.{h,cc}
gillespie/midpointleap.{h,cc}
random/rng.{h,cc}
random/xoroshiro128plus.{h,cc}

Licenses for reused and modified code:

long poisson_ptrs(double mean) implements the PTRS 
algorithm of Wolfgang Hoermann (1993) and is based upon the
function rk_poisson_ptrs from the mtrand module 
of numpy, available here:
github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/random/mtrand/distributions.c

That function appears with the following copyright and license:
